What is C++?
 ->  C++ is a high-performance programming language used for system programming, competitive programming, and Data Structures & Algorithms.
->   It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming.


==> Topic 1: Basic Input/Output in C++ : 
        Definition 
        Input/Output in C++ uses:

        cin → to take input
        cout → to print output

        From the header file: #include <iostream>
        Namespace used: using namespace std;


==> Topic 2: Variables, Data Types & Operators :
        Definition 
                Variables:

                A variable is a named storage location in memory used to store data.
                Example:
                int age = 20;
        
        Data Types:
            They define what kind of data a variable can store.
            
            Common types in C++:
                int → whole numbers
                float / double → decimal values
                char → single character
                string → text
                bool → true/false

            Operators:
            Symbols used to perform operations like

                Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
                Relational (==, !=, >, <)
                Logical (&&, ||, !)
                Assignment (=, +=, -=, etc.)


==> Topic 3: Control Statements (If/Else, Loops) :

        Control Statements : 
        ->These are used to control the flow of a program.

            There are 3 main types:

            A. Conditional Statements :

                Used to make decisions:
                if
                if-else
                else-if
                switch

            B. Looping Statements :

                Used to repeat code:
                for loop
                while loop
                do-while loop

            C. Jump Statements :
                break
                continue

==> Topic 4: Arrays :

    -> Definition : 
        An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in continuous (contiguous) memory, and accessed using index numbers.
    -> Indexing starts from 0.

    Array Important Properties(In DSA)
        Fast access: O(1)
        Fixed size
        Memory continuous 
        Searching O(n)
        Insertion/Deletion costly (O(n))
